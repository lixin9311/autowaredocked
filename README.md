## ros+cuda docked

Run ROS Indigo / Ubuntu Trusty and cuda within Docker on Ubuntu Xenial or on any platform with a shared
username, home directory, and X11.

This enables you to build and run a persistent ROS Indigo workspace as long as
you can run Docker images.

Note that the Nvidia cuda library sometime downloads very slow, so I make another Dockerfile ros-cuda in case we need some modification
on the build script.

After the building, you may build Autoware as you like.

For more info on Docker see here: https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/ubuntulinux/

### Build

This will create the image with your user/group ID and home directory.

```
./build.sh IMAGE_NAME
```

### Run

This will run the docker image.

```
./dock.sh IMAGE_NAME
```

The image shares it's  network interface with the host, so you can run this in
multiple terminals for multiple hooks into the docker environment.
